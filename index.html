            <h1>Dream Big</h1>
            <h3>Become a Senior Scientific Researcher</h3>
            <p>I have done three research work till now. Those research works are:
                1.An overview of Mobile Edge Computing in vehicle platooning
                2.A Comprehensible Technique towards a Hybrid Agile Approach with an Integrated Framework
                Architecture:using SCRUM, XP, DSDM, and FDD Models
                3.Estimating The Effect Of COVID-19 Outbreak On Mental Health Of General Population research project
                (Bangladesh)
                The first research work is about Mobile Edge Computing in vehicle platooning where a task offloading in
                vehicle platooning was analyzed. In th second research work I constructed a well-organized hybrid
                framework that will help software
                industries to develop business-based software by following my proposed
                software model.Last research work is bout The Effect Of COVID-19 Outbreak On Mental
                Health Of General Population. </p>
